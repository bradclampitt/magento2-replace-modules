# Magento 2 - Removal of Optional Modules

This repository contains a composer meta-package that removes those optional magento modules that we don't use.

To install this package, use the following:
```bash
composer require bradclampitt/magento2-replace-modules
```

## Notes
This is a work in progress and is not yet complete.
